# BotKit (Swift)

An implementation of a Slack bot in Swift.

## Goals
- Welcome new members to the group
- Announce in `#lobby` about newly created channels (with their purpose)
- Announce in `#lobby` about newly created emoji
- Provide a way for users to anonymously complain about other users (`/complain @eve she always snoops on my conversations`)
